### Data Source

Data was given by the Company in excel format. I downloaded the csv file, and extracted it into Excel for cleaning, analysis and visualization.

### Tools

I cleaned the data efficiently and did some transformations with excel, Some of the applied steps include;
- Making the clean data into a table format
- Making first row has headers
- Cleaning the data
- Transferring the clean data into pivot table for visualization

### Data Analysis

I created a pivot table to enable slicing and dicing the data by date attributes such as weekday, month, quarter, and year as needed. This setup allowed me to use a Pivot Table to analyze the data more effectively.

### Results/Findings

The analysis results are summerized as follows

- The top-performing salesperson is Nancy Freehafer with $17,138 in revenue.
- Jan Kotas has the lowest revenue among salespersons, with $979.
- Total Revenue: $70,244.08
- Total Orders: 65
- Average Revenue per Order: $1,081
- Total Number of Customers: 15
- New York (NY) leads in revenue with $12,369.

### Recommendations

Based on the data in your sales performance dashboard, here are some recommendations ;

1. Leverage Top Sales Performers: With Nancy Freehafer as the top salesperson, consider analyzing her sales approach or strategies to see if they can be replicated or shared across the team to boost overall performance.

2. Focus on High-Revenue States:New York (NY) and Colorado (CO) have strong revenue contributions. Consider directing more resources, marketing efforts, or sales team focus towards these states to capitalize on their high performance.

3. Enhance Average Revenue per Order: With an average order revenue of $1,081, exploring strategies to upsell or cross-sell during customer interactions could help boost this figure. Training sales teams on upselling techniques or bundling popular products can increase the average order size.

4. Increase Customer Base: With 15 customers contributing to the total revenue, consider expanding customer acquisition efforts. Targeted campaigns or loyalty programs in high-performing states could help attract new customers and retain existing ones.

### Limitations

With only aggregate data, thereâ€™s limited information on customer demographics, preferences, or purchasing behavior. This makes it challenging to tailor sales strategies to specific customer needs or to identify key customer segments.
